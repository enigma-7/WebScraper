The conformal transformation properties of Wilson lines are not quite the naive ones, but at NLO acquire an additional anomalous piece. We construct explicitly the inversion symmetry generator. We also show how to construct for every operator O\n, including the Hamiltonian itself, its \"conformal extension\" \\cal O\n, such that it transforms under the inversion in the naive way.", "bibtex": "@article{Kovner_2014,\n   title={Conformal symmetry of JIMWLK evolution at NLO},\n   volume={2014},\n   ISSN={1029-8479},\n   url={http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/JHEP04(2014)030},\n   DOI={10.1007/jhep04(2014)030},\n   number={4},\n   journal={Journal of High Energy Physics},\n   publisher={Springer Science and Business Media LLC},\n   author={Kovner, Alex and Lublinsky, Michael and Mulian, Yair},\n   year={2014},\n   month={Apr}\n}"}

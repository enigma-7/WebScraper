Mueller (Columbia University)", "Abstract": "A simple derivation of the Jalilian-Marian, Iancu, McLerran, Weigert, Leonidov and Kovner (JIMWLK) equation for the evolution of small-x QCD wavefunctions is given. The derivation makes use of the equivalence between the evolution of a (in general complicated) small-x wavefunction with that of the evolution of the (simple) dipole probing the wavefunction in a high energy scattering.", "bibtex": "@article{Mueller_2001,\n   title={A simple derivation of the JIMWLK equation},\n   volume={523},\n   ISSN={0370-2693},\n   url={http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0370-2693(01)01343-0},\n   DOI={10.1016/s0370-2693(01)01343-0},\n   number={3-4},\n   journal={Physics Letters B},\n   publisher={Elsevier BV},\n   author={Mueller, A.H.},\n   year={2001},\n   month={Dec},\n   pages={243\u2013248}\n}"}

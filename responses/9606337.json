We extend the McLerran-Venugopalan model by using renormalization group methods to integrate out effects due to those gluons which generate an effective classical charge density for Weizs\u00e4cker-Williams fields. We argue that this model can be extended from the description of nuclei at small x to the description of hadrons at yet smaller values of x. This generates a Lipatov like enhancement for the intrinsic gluon distribution function and a non-trivial transverse momentum dependence as well. We estimate the transverse momentum dependence for the distribution functions, and show how the issue of unitarity is resolved in lepton-nucleus interactions.", "bibtex": "@article{Jalilian_Marian_1997,\n   title={Intrinsic glue distribution at very smallx},\n   volume={55},\n   ISSN={1089-4918},\n   url={http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.55.5414},\n   DOI={10.1103/physrevd.55.5414},\n   number={9},\n   journal={Physical Review D},\n   publisher={American Physical Society (APS)},\n   author={Jalilian-Marian, Jamal and Kovner, Alex and McLerran, Larry and Weigert, Heribert},\n   year={1997},\n   month={May},\n   pages={5414\u20135428}\n}"}

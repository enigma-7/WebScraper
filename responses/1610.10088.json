The proof of this construction algorithm uses the iterative method described by Keppeler and Sj\u00f6dahl. We further show that Hermitian Young projection operators share desirable properties with Young tableaux, namely a nested hierarchy when \"adding a particle\". We end by exhibiting the enormous advantage of the Hermitian Young projection operators constructed in this paper over those given by Keppeler and Sj\u00f6dahl.", "bibtex": "@article{Alcock_Zeilinger_2017,\n   title={Compact Hermitian Young projection operators},\n   volume={58},\n   ISSN={1089-7658},\n   url={http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4983478},\n   DOI={10.1063/1.4983478},\n   number={5},\n   journal={Journal of Mathematical Physics},\n   publisher={AIP Publishing},\n   author={Alcock-Zeilinger, J. and Weigert, H.},\n   year={2017},\n   month={May},\n   pages={051702}\n}"}

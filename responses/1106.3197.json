{"url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3197v2", "Title": "Clifford Algebras and Spinors", "Authors": "Ivan Todorov", "Abstract": "Expository notes on Clifford algebras and spinors with a detailed discussion of Majorana, Weyl, and Dirac spinors. The paper is meant as a review of background material, needed, in particular, in now fashionable theoretical speculations on neutrino masses. It has a more mathematical flavour than the over twenty-seven-year-old \"Introduction to Majorana masses\" by P.D. Mannheim and includes historical notes and biographical data on past participants in the story.", "bibtex": "@misc{todorov2011clifford,\n    title={Clifford Algebras and Spinors},\n    author={Ivan Todorov},\n    year={2011},\n    eprint={1106.3197},\n    archivePrefix={arXiv},\n    primaryClass={math-ph}\n}"}

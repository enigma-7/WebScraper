We express the full nonlinear renormalization group equation in terms of the average value and the average fluctuation of extra color charge density generated by integrating out gluons with intermediate values of\nx\n. This form clearly exhibits the nature of the phenomena driving the evolution and should serve as the basis of the analysis of saturation effects at high gluon density at small\nx\n.", "bibtex": "@article{Jalilian_Marian_1998,\n   title={Wilson renormalization group for lowxphysics: Towards the high density regime},\n   volume={59},\n   ISSN={1089-4918},\n   url={http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.59.014014},\n   DOI={10.1103/physrevd.59.014014},\n   number={1},\n   journal={Physical Review D},\n   publisher={American Physical Society (APS)},\n   author={Jalilian-Marian, Jamal and Kovner, Alex and Leonidov, Andrei and Weigert, Heribert},\n   year={1998},\n   month={Nov}\n}"}

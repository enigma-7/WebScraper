M\u00e4ntysaari", "Abstract": "We include resummation of large transverse logarithms into the next-to-leading order Balitsky-Kovchegov equation. The resummed NLO evolution equation is shown to be stable, the evolution speed being significantly reduced by higher order corrections. The contributions from\n\u03b1\n2\ns\nterms that are not enhanced by large logarithms are found to be numerically important close to phenomenologically relevant initial conditions.", "bibtex": "@misc{lappi2016balitskykovchegov,\n    title={Balitsky-Kovchegov equation at next-to-leading order accuracy with a resummation of large logarithms},\n    author={T.

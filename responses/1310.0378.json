The form of the Hamiltonian is deduced from the symmetries and the structure of the hadronic light cone wavefunction and by comparing the rapidity evolution of the quark dipole and the three-quark singlet states with results available in the literature. The next-to-leading corrections should allow for more robust phenomenological applications of perturbative saturation approach.", "bibtex": "@article{Kovner_2014,\n   title={Jalilian-Marian, Iancu, McLerran, Weigert, Leonidov, Kovner evolution at next to leading order},\n   volume={89},\n   ISSN={1550-2368},\n   url={http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.89.061704},\n   DOI={10.1103/physrevd.89.061704},\n   number={6},\n   journal={Physical Review D},\n   publisher={American Physical Society (APS)},\n   author={Kovner, Alex and Lublinsky, Michael and Mulian, Yair},\n   year={2014},\n   month={Mar}\n}"}

We show that the Hermitian Young projection operators together with their transition operators constitute a fully orthogonal basis for the algebra of invariants of\nV\n\u2297m\nthat exhibits a systematically simplified multiplication table. We discuss the full algebra of invariants over\nV\n\u22973\nand\nV\n\u22974\nas explicit examples. In our presentation we make use of various standard concepts such as Young projection operators, Clebsch-Gordan operators, and invariants (in birdtrack notation). We tie these perspectives together and use them to shed light on each other.", "bibtex": "@article{Alcock_Zeilinger_2017,\n   title={Transition operators},\n   volume={58},\n   ISSN={1089-7658},\n   url={http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4983479},\n   DOI={10.1063/1.4983479},\n   number={5},\n   journal={Journal of Mathematical Physics},\n   publisher={AIP Publishing},\n   author={Alcock-Zeilinger, J. and Weigert, H.},\n   year={2017},\n   month={May},\n   pages={051703}\n}"}

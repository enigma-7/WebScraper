{"url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03754v2", "Title": "Resummation of non-global logarithms and the BFKL equation", "Authors": "Simon Caron-Huot", "Abstract": "We consider a `color density matrix' in gauge theory. We argue that it systematically resums large logarithms originating from wide-angle soft radiation, sometimes referred to as non-global logarithms, to all logarithmic orders. We calculate its anomalous dimension at leading- and next-to-leading order. Combined with a conformal transformation known to relate this problem to shockwave scattering in the Regge limit, this is used to rederive the next-to-leading order Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov equation (including its nonlinear generalization, the so-called Balitsky-JIMWLK equation), finding perfect agreement with the literature. Exponentiation of divergences to all logarithmic orders is demonstrated. The possibility of obtaining the evolution equation (and BFKL) to three-loop is discussed.", "bibtex": "@misc{caronhuot2015resummation,\n    title={Resummation of non-global logarithms and the BFKL equation},\n    author={Simon Caron-Huot},\n    year={2015},\n    eprint={1501.03754},\n    archivePrefix={arXiv},\n    primaryClass={hep-ph}\n}"}

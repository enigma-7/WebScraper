At strong coupling, the virtual and static photon produced in e^+e^- annihilation can be treated as a shock wave propagating in AdS space leaving spherical energy and charge distributions on the boundary. This is shown to be mathematically identical to the computation of energy and charge distributions in the transverse plane generated by a high energy color singlet state. At weak coupling, the correspondence is useful in studying interjet observables. By performing the stereographic projection to the BFKL equation, we construct an exact solution to the evolution equation derived by Marchesini and Mueller, and find the angular distribution of small-x gluons in the interjet region. Finally we argue that the correspondence holds also for the energy correlation functions.", "bibtex": "@misc{hatta2008relating,\n    title={Relating $e^+e^-$ annihilation to high energy scattering at weak and strong coupling},\n    author={Yoshitaka Hatta},\n    year={2008},\n    eprint={0810.0889},\n    archivePrefix={arXiv},\n    primaryClass={hep-ph}\n}"}

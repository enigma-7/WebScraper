The solution is based on functional Fokker-Planck methods. The fixed point at small x is explicitly calculated and all correlation functions in this limit are determined. They show clear saturation and unitarization properties. Scaling laws that hold during the saturation phase and throughout the whole course of the evolution are established. The corresponding Langevin equations are given as a basis for numerical simulations opening the field for future studies of dynamical issues of the evolution not analytically accessible. The methods used may be extended to the ``target side'' equations of Jalilian-Marian, Kovner, Leonidov and Weigert.", "bibtex": "@article{Weigert_2002,\n   title={Unitarity at small Bjorken x},\n   volume={703},\n   ISSN={0375-9474},\n   url={http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0375-9474(01)01668-2},\n   DOI={10.1016/s0375-9474(01)01668-2},\n   number={3-4},\n   journal={Nuclear Physics A},\n   publisher={Elsevier BV},\n   author={Weigert, Heribert},\n   year={2002},\n   month={Jun},\n   pages={823\u2013860}\n}"}

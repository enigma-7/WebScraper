It is shown that in the linearized, weak field regime the RG equation reduces to the BFKL equation for the evolution of the unintegrated gluon density. We discuss the relation of this approach with that of Lipatov.", "bibtex": "@article{Jalilian_Marian_1997,\n   title={The BFKL equation from the Wilson renormalization group},\n   volume={504},\n   ISSN={0550-3213},\n   url={http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0550-3213(97)00440-9},\n   DOI={10.1016/s0550-3213(97)00440-9},\n   number={1-2},\n   journal={Nuclear Physics B},\n   publisher={Elsevier BV},\n   author={Jalilian-Marian, Jamal and Kovner, Alex and Leonidov, Andrei and Weigert, Heribert},\n   year={1997},\n   month={Oct},\n   pages={415\u2013431}\n}"}

Smye", "Abstract": "We consider interjet observables in hard QCD processes given by the energy flow E_out in a region away from all hard jets. Here the QCD radiation is depleted (E_out << Q), and therefore these observables provide ideal means to study non-perturbative effects. We derive an evolution equation (in the large N_c limit) which resums, for large Q/E_out, all leading terms arising from large angle soft emission (double logarithms are absent). We discuss the analytical features of the result and identify universal and geometry-dependent contributions. Our analysis confirms features found using numerical methods by Dasgupta and Salam.", "bibtex": "@article{Banfi_2002,\n   title={Away-from-jet energy flow},\n   volume={2002},\n   ISSN={1029-8479},\n   url={http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1126-6708/2002/08/006},\n   DOI={10.1088/1126-6708/2002/08/006},\n   number={08},\n   journal={Journal of High Energy Physics},\n   publisher={Springer Science and Business Media LLC},\n   author={Banfi, Andrea and Marchesini, Giuseppe and Smye, Graham},\n   year={2002},\n   month={Aug},\n   pages={006\u2013006}\n}"}

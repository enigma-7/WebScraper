Banfi, Marchesini, and Smye have derived an evolution equation for non-global jet observables that exhibits a remarkable analogy with the BK equation used in the small x context. Here, this analogy is used to generalize the former beyond the leading N_c approximation. The result shows striking analogy with the JIMWLK equation describing the small x evolution of the color glass condensate. A Langevin description allows numerical implementation and provides clues for the formulation of closed forms for amplitudes at finite N_c. The proof of the new equation is based on these amplitudes with ordered soft emission. It is fully independent of the derivation of the JIMWLK equation and thus sheds new light also on this topic.", "bibtex": "@misc{weigert2003nonglobal,\n    title={Non-global jet evolution at finite N_c},\n    author={Heribert Weigert},\n    year={2003},\n    eprint={hep-ph/0312050},\n    archivePrefix={arXiv},\n    primaryClass={hep-ph}\n}"}

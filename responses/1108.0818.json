{"url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.0818v2", "Title": "Towards thermalization in heavy-ion collisions: CGC meets the 2PI formalism", "Authors": "Yoshitaka Hatta, Akihiro Nishiyama", "Abstract": "We propose to apply the two-particle irreducible (2PI) formalism to the problem of thermalization in heavy-ion collisions in the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) picture. We consider the 2PI effective action to three loops and derive a set of coupled equations for the classical Yang-Mills field and the quantum fluctuations in the boost invariant coordinate system. The initial condition and the relation to previous works are also discussed.", "bibtex": "@misc{hatta2011thermalization,\n    title={Towards thermalization in heavy-ion collisions: CGC meets the 2PI formalism},\n    author={Yoshitaka Hatta and Akihiro Nishiyama},\n    year={2011},\n    eprint={1108.0818},\n    archivePrefix={arXiv},\n    primaryClass={hep-ph}\n}"}

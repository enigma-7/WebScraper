As a byproduct, we find a hidden symmetry of the BMS equation which is a remnant of conformal symmetry.", "bibtex": "@article{Hatta_2009,\n   title={Jet energy flow at the LHC},\n   volume={80},\n   ISSN={1550-2368},\n   url={http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.80.074018},\n   DOI={10.1103/physrevd.80.074018},\n   number={7},\n   journal={Physical Review D},\n   publisher={American Physical Society (APS)},\n   author={Hatta, Yoshitaka and Ueda, Takahiro},\n   year={2009},\n   month={Oct}\n}"}
